# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
House Price Prediction Project
Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project! This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to forecast house prices, providing valuable insights for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

Project Overview
In the dynamic real estate market, accurate house price prediction is crucial for making informed decisions. This project addresses this need by developing a predictive model that considers various features such as:

Property Characteristics: Analyzing factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location.
Neighborhood Trends: Incorporating data on local amenities, school districts, and crime rates.
Historical Data: Utilizing past house sale records to improve predictions.
Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform raw data for better model accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Select relevant features and create new ones to enhance prediction power.
Model Selection: Implement regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forests).
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ².
Technologies Used
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data handling.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing regression models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
